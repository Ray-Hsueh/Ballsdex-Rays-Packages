# Adding Custom Package to BallsDex

> [!TIP]
> In most cases, each folder represents a custom package.

Follow these steps to add your custom package to BallsDex(we will use `broadcast` as example):

## Step 1: Go To The Right Directory
1. Navigate to the `ballsdex/packages` directory.

## Step 2: Download Custom Files
1. Download the necessary files from this repository.
2. In this case, please download the folder named `broadcast`. 
3. Place the whole folder into the `ballsdex/packages` directory.

## Step 3: Update Configuration
1. Open the `config.yml` file in your BallsDex project.
2. Add the path to your custom package in the configuration.

```yaml
packages:
    - ballsdex.packages.broadcast
```

## Step 4: Load the Custom Package
1. Ensure your bot is configured to load the custom package.
2. Restart your bot to apply the changes.

## Step 5: Verify Installation
1. Check the bot logs to ensure the custom package is loaded without errors.
2. Use the bot commands to verify the custom functionality is working as expected.

By following these steps, you can successfully add and use the custom package in BallsDex.

*All files have only been tested in version 2.26.2 and may have errors due to translation issues. The English version of the code you are looking at may not work because it has never been run on my bot. You can fix the error and open a PR or contact me to see if there is a way to fix it.*
